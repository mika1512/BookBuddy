## Overview of the Project

Project Title: BookBuddy Library Management System

The project is creating an online library administration system meant to simplify book renting and review procedure. Two separate interfaces—an administrative and a user interface—will be included into the program. Registered users will be able to rent books for a designated period, search the library's collection, filter books by author, category, or publishing, and so navigate the user interface Additionally able to pay for rentals straight through the app, users will be able to like and evaluate books they have read, therefore supporting a community-driven assessment system.

From the administrative standpoint, the administrative interface will let library employees effectively handle book inventory. Administrators may track rental book availability, change current listings, and list new books. To guarantee prompt returns and best book circulation, the system will also have features to track late rentals and send email alerts to consumers when their lease expiry dates get near.

Using contemporary web technologies and a user-centric design, this application seeks to improve the operational effectiveness and user experience of the library. By means of a safe and flawless login experience offered by the connection with Google for authentication, users are guaranteed that only authorised persons may access the system. This project not only meets the present demands of the library but also lays the groundwork for further improvements like sophisticated search features and tailored suggestions depending on user preferences and reading background.

## Objectives

The creation of a comprehensive library administration system that would completely automate the processes involved in library administration is the goal of this project. The indexing of books, the administration of users, the borrowing and returning of books, and the tracking of books that are long overdue are all processes that will be included in these procedures.
